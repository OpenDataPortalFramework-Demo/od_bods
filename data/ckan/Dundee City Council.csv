Deprivation in this context refers to the range of problems that arise due to the lack of resources or opportunities covering health, safety, education, employment, housing and access to services as well as financial aspects.\r\n\r\nThe most recent Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation was released by the Scottish Government in 2020. The SIMD divides Scotland into 6,976 small areas called data zones with roughly an equal population in each data zone. The Scottish Government then look at the indicators to measure the different sides of deprivation in each data zone including pupil performance, travel times to GP\u2019s, crime, unemployment etc. These 38 indicators of deprivation are then grouped into 7 types called domains. These domains are:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Income \u2022 Employment \u2022 Education \u2022 Health \u2022 Access to Services \u2022 Crime \u2022 Housing\r\n\r\nThe 7 domains are combined into one SIMD, ranking each data zone in Scotland from 1 (Most Deprived) to 6,976 (Least Deprived). The SIMD allows organisations to target policies and place resources in the areas with greatest need.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries used to collate the SIMD are based on the 2011 data zones which were produced by the Scottish Government. These are the same boundaries which were used in the 2016 SIMD. Earlier SIMD's published before 2016 were based on the Scottish Governments 2001 based data zones. This means that the data zones used in these publications are not comparable with the 2020 and 2016 SIMD.\r\n\r\nThis dataset shows SIMD 2020 data for Dundee City.

This is done through an online reporting system called WasteDataFlow (WDF). Reports are submitted to SEPA annually, with a submission deadline of 28 February.  \r\n\r\nLocal authority waste data are verified on an annual basis by the Data Unit and are used to help fulfill Scotland\u2019s reporting obligations to the Scottish Government and Europe. The data from WasteDataFlow is used to populate Scotland\u2019s Environment [Household Waste Data Analysis Tool](https://www.environment.gov.scot/data/data-analysis/household-waste/). The tool shows a break-down of household waste generated and managed by waste type for 2011 \u2013 2015 and the trends for household waste generated, recycled and managed since 2004. \r\n\r\nThe Scotland\u2019s Environment [Waste Discover Data tool](https://www.environment.gov.scot/data/data-analysis/waste-from-all-sources/) presents waste from all sources, i.e. from households, the construction and demolition sector, and from commerce and industry. The tool shows a break-down of waste types for 2011 \u2013 2015 and the trend for Scottish waste landfilled since 2005.\r\n\r\nAll data can be exported to Excel if required."
