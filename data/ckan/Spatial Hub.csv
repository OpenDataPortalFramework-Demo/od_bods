AQMAs must be designated officially by means of an 'order'.  The extent of the AQMA may be limited to the area of exceedance or encompass a larger area.  Following the declaration of an AQMA, the local authority is required to develop and implement a plan (Air Quality Action Plan) to improve air quality in that area. AQMAs can be for a combination of NO2, SO2, PM10.  Most data provided by local authorities is in polygon format. However, some is provided in point and line form so we are currently buffering such data by the width of a road or so in order to merge them in to the national polygon dataset. Some smaller local authorities e.g. Dundee, use the entire extent of their local authority, as digitised in Ordnance Survey's BoundaryLine dataset, for the AQMA.  We have included date of AQMA declaration in our national schema, though many LAs do not currently provide this. Revoked AQMAs are now held in this dataset with a 'Date revoked' attribute"

An Article 4 Direction is not a conservation designation but an additional control within such areas. It is a statement made under The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2011. The Direction, made by a local authority and approved by Scottish Ministers, removes all or some of the permitted development rights on an area.  The effect of a Direction is that planning permission will be required for specific types of development which would otherwise be regarded as 'permitted development', i.e. development that does not require a planning application. Directions can cover a variety of minor works and might include: the replacement of doors and windows, the erection of gates, fences, garages, sheds, porches, storage tanks or the installation of satellite antennae.  This dataset should be used in conjunction with the Article 4 Directions dataset also published on a Scotland-wide basis."

The environmental, financial and legal implications of this can be substantial.  The management and remediation of contaminated land that, in its current state, is causing or has the potential to cause significant harm or significant pollution of the water environment, is regulated by legislation and underpinned by the core principles of the 'polluter pays' and a 'suitable for use approach'.  Local authorities are the primary regulator for the contaminated land regime (SEPA also has certain responsibilities within the scope of the legislation) to regulate activities and assist in the management and remediation of contaminated land.  The current regulation regarding Contaminated Land is contained within the Environmental Protection Act (1990) known as Part IIA. Part IIA is further established in Scotland by the Contaminated Land (Scotland) Regulations 2000 (SSI 2000/178), as amended and the Scottish Government's Statutory Guidance: Edition 2 provides the detailed framework for the definition, identification and remediation of contaminated land.  THIS SPATIAL DATASET IS ONLY CONFIRMED CONTAMINATED LAND AND DOES NOT INCLUDE POTENTIALLY CONTAMINATED LAND  Site name, date designated, website URL (for further information), status (confirmed or remediated) and remediation dates (where applicable) are all now mandatory attributes for this dataset."

Core paths are paths, waterways or any other means of crossing land to facilitate, promote and manage the exercise of access rights under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, and are identified as such in access authority core paths plan.  There are, intentionally, no set physical standards for core paths. This means that core paths can physically be anything from a faint line across a field to a fully constructed path, track or pavement. The National Access Forum, Scottish Natural Heritage and Scottish Government are encouraging information to be surveyed and made publicly available, in a nationally-standardised form, so that the public will know what physical type of route they can expect.

Principal third party data suppliers include:  - Ordnance Survey (greenspace and water body data)  - Scottish Government (Scotland’s Heat Map)  - Energy Saving Trust (Home Analytics)  Please reference the Data Guide and Methodology report (attached to the metadata record as an associated resource) and send any further queries on the quality/ accuracy of the data to parkpower@greenspacescotland.org.uk.   GHiGs Settlements:   A public summary of indicators for GHiGs analysis of low carbon heat based on data aggregated to Scotland’s 516 settlements. Settlement boundaries are from 2012 derived from National Records of Scotland to be consistent with those used by Scotland’s Heat Map v.2. Settlements are defined as places with populations greater than 500. Approximately 90% of Scotland’s population lives in settlements.

This, in turn, helps inform land releases within the Local Development Plan process and ongoing development management decisions. A five-year effective housing land supply is required at all times.  This dataset contains full details - where available - of site references, site size (hectares), capacity (in housing units), completions, remaining supply and annual forecast phasing over a period of years, also a record of past completions, including aggregations of 2009 and earlier and 2027 and beyond, where these have been grouped as such. Further details of greenfield/brownfield status, tenure, effectiveness (deliverable within the period), constraints, planning details/status and developer are also provided where available.  The datasets have been drawn from a variety of sources, including comprehensive regional datasets (ClydePlan) and the joining of spatial and tabular data. This includes allocated and planned sites, which typically have fuller details of forecast phasing (etc) and also ""windfall"" and small sites (where included), which may be one-off rather than longer-term developments, with less detail. Some of these sites lack spatial geometry and have been represented by a square buffer on a recorded X/Y easting/northing, based on site size, if this information is available."

Some of it is derived from sale of land based on historical ownership, but it should not be used for decision making, it is designed as an aid to assist interested parties in identifying where to start their enquiries.

Mine Water Geothermal Resource Atlas - Scotland,Improvement Service, https://data.spatialhub.scot/dataset/mine_water_geothermal_resource_atlas-is,https://geo.spatialhub.scot/geoserver/sh_mwgt/gwc/service/wmts?authkey=b85aa063-d598-4582-8e45-e7e6048718fc,Mine Water Geothermal Resource Atlas,2023-04-11T13:15:43.832932,2023-04-11T14:03:23.091477,,B,other,,,,UK Open Government Licence (OGL),"A Web Mapping Feature layer identifying optimal locations across Scotland for mine water geothermal development.  Mine water geothermal energy describes the low-carbon practice of using water held in abandoned flooded mines to heat or cool surface thermal demands. The low temperatures (as low as 10°C) require heat pump technology to upgrade thermal energy to usable temperatures for heating homes or industrial applications. The intention of the mine water geothermal resource atlas is to highlight optimal areas to exploit MWG energy in Scotland. If the scale of Scotland’s mine water thermal resource, estimated at 12 GW, becomes better communicated we envisage that this atlas will prove influential for increasing the rate and success of MWG deployment. Ideally, the provision of feasible MWG sites will influence stakeholder decisions i.e., where to invest and develop land to make the best use of the low-carbon resource, resulting in MWG potential included as part of a standard appraisal for a residential or industrial development plan. Whilst it is acknowledged that focused expert input would be required to integrate surface heat demand and subsurface resources in detail, the atlas provides non-experts and decision makers with a first-pass high-level summary of the potential MWG resource located within their area of interest.   The four criteria for site selection are summarised below:  1.         There are more than one (overlapping) mined seams. 2.         The mined seams are deeper than 30 m to minimise subsidence risk. 3.         The mine water head (i.e., mine “water table”) is not excessively deep (< 60 m below ground level) to avoid excessive pumping costs. 4.         The mined seams are shallower than 250 m below ground level to minimise drilling costs.  As a result, this atlas has identified a total of 370.3 km2 across 19 local authority areas which are most suitable for MWG development.  Symbology: The calculated depths for mine water head (Criterion 3) are mapped in 10 m increments with shallower values (0 m – 20 m BGL) shown in shades of pink and deeper values (20 m - 60 m BGL) shown in shades of blue. Where mine water head is shallow (0 m - 20 m BGL) there may be some risk that reinjection may cause mine water heads to approach the surface (depending on the transmissivity of the workings). “Open loop with discharge” may be more feasible for areas with very shallow mine water (0 m - 20 m BGL), but may require additional permitting (discharge consents) and available land for treatment depending on water chemistry. Areas shaded blue (20 m - 60 m BGL) correlate with deeper mine water heads which are most suited to the ‘open-loop with reinjection’ configuration. Both configurations are presented in Walls et al. (2022) - https://doi.org/10.3390/en14196215. Depths greater than 60 m BGL are not included since they indicate situations which would face excessive pumping costs."

Scotland had a great tradition of publishing descriptive (long-form) gazetteers in the 19th century.   This dataset is the GIS point format output from a project funded by the Scottish Government in the early 2010s, to create a Definitive Place-Name Gazetteer for Scotland, which helped meet the INSPIRE requirements for a place-name layer. The data also forms the underlying content for the Gazetteer for Scotland web pages: https://www.scottish-places.info/   In 2009 a workshop was run in conjunction with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Scotland (RCAHMS) to examine the range of gazetteers in use in Scotland, together with a broad set of requirements. This identified a number of organisations which hold or maintain at least 15 different gazetteers that include geographical names for Scotland. The two most significant gazetteers were the Gazetteer for Scotland and the Ordnance Survey 1:50000 (OS 1:50K) product – which forms the basis for this dataset.   The Gazetteer for Scotland is a descriptive gazetteer, with a modest number (22,000) of rich entries, including a textual description and rich feature-typing. The OS 1:50K gazetteer has long been Ordnance Survey's only place-name gazetteer, used as part of numerous applications.  It was decided that, for this new 'definitive' place name gazetteer, any named feature could/ should potentially be included, but it was accepted that the list will always be incomplete.   This dataset could be used (and potentially linked with) other datasets like the One Scotland Gazetteer and the Historical Names gazetteer.  The methodology for this data was a combination of automated and manual editing. Automated methods were used in feature classification and duplicate detection. Manual editing was required both to confirm or provide a feature classification, but also to improve the spatial referencing.  Standards had to be adopted; for example water bodies were spatially located by a point which approximated its centre while rivers were spatially located at their termination and other liner features by a random point along their length. The former gives a useful spatial reference, the latter in many cases does not.  Quality checking suggests that 95% of points were located to 100m or better, and 5% located to 20m or better. More than 90% of features are classified correctly, on the basis of the evidence available"

For the purposes of planning applications, development in Scotland is put into one of three categories – 'local', 'major' or 'national'. The different categories mean that applications are treated in a way which is suited to the size and complexity of the proposed development and the issues they are likely to raise. Most applications will be for 'local' developments. 'Major' developments include applications for 50 or more homes, certain waste, water, transport and energy-related developments, and larger retail developments. 'National' developments are specific projects which have been identified in the National Planning Framework because of their national importance. Scottish Ministers become involved in a small minority of cases, but only do so where it involves a matter of genuine national interest.  This dataset consists of 4 separate layers:   1.

Under section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and Under part 6, section 37 of the Water Resources (Scotland) Act 2013 SEPA, Scottish Water and Local Authorities all have a responsibility for the registration, management and compliance of Septic Tanks within Scotland. The Scottish Assessors also currently identifies 678 septic tanks. These are tanks that serve more than one dwelling. Those that serve just one dwelling may be treated as an appurtenance of the dwelling i.e. they are classified as domestic and treated as being reflected in the Council Tax band.  SEPA have approximately a quarter of the Septic Tanks mapped as it has only been a requirement since 2012 that when buying or selling a house that these get licenced. Scottish Water have partial information (not included as data not provided in a suitable format) and Scottish Assessors collect some as well (not included due to percieved licensing restrictions). SEPA, Local Authorities, Scottish Water and Scottish Assessors are keen to combine data to create a complete and comprehensive view of all Septic Tanks in Scotland."

In practice, this means that in a smoke control area it is illegal to burn house coal or wood in an open fire, although it is legal to burn these in a stove or other appliance that has been approved to burn that fuel. It is also illegal to deliver any unauthorised solid fuels, e.g. wood and normal house coal, to any premises in a smoke control area unless the seller can demonstrate that they were aware that the unauthorised solid fuel is to be burnt in an exempt appliance.  Site name, designation date and website URL (for more information) are now mandatory attributes for this dataset."

The dataset is created under the provisions as listed within The Town and Country Planning (Tree Preservation Order and Trees in Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Regulations 2010. Spatial and attribute data is maintained in ArcMap shapefile with extra attributes in a spreadsheet (including link to TPO PDF). Planning technicians ensure that data is updated regularly once new information about a TPO is provided, a new TPO is registered or a TPO has been removed. The conservation officers or senior management advise and direct planning technicians to create a draft TPO location plan which is then sent to the paralegal team. The paralegals then carry out their duties in confirming and registering the TPO and informing any interested party. The planning technician then updates the spatial data in ArcMap which, once finalised, is then sent to GIS staff to update into Location Centre. The data will be of interest to staff within PKC who are interested in identifying or collecting TPO data for their own professional purposes e.g. Development Management (planning application, LDP , supplementary guidance) and Greenspace (maintenance and retention of natural assets). The dataset is available for general public use, stakeholders or any interested party outside the Council to identify TPOs."

However:  - where local authorities have not provided spatial data for the current year, their previous spatial data return has been used.  - where there is no spatial data at all for sites we have buffered the easting and northing provided in the survey, to create a circular polygon area for a site."

However:  - where local authorities have not provided spatial data for the current year, we have used their previous spatial data return and matched the survey data as best we can, - where there is no spatial data at all for sites we have buffered the easting and northing provided in the survey, to create the rough polygon area for a site.

However:  - where local authorities have not provided spatial data for the current year, we have used their previous spatial data return and matched the survey data as best we can, - where there is no spatial data at all for sites we have buffered the easting and northing provided in the survey, to create the rough polygon area for a site.

Further consideration will be required to demonstrate that any significant effects on the qualities of these areas can be substantially overcome by siting, design or other mitigation.  National and international designations: 		World Heritage Sites; 		Natura 2000 and Ramsar sites; 		Sites of Special Scientific Interest; 		National Nature Reserves; 		Sites identified in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes; 		Sites identified in the Inventory of Historic Battlefields.  Other nationally important mapped environmental interests: 		areas of wild land as shown on the 2014 NatureScot map of wild land areas; 		carbon rich soils, deep peat and priority peatland habitat.  Community separation for consideration of visual impact: an area not exceeding 2km around cities, towns and villages identified on the local development plan with an identified settlement envelope or edge. The extent of the area will be determined by the planning authority based on landform and other features which restrict views out from the settlement.  Group 3 - Area with potential for wind farm development:  Beyond groups 1 and 2, wind farms are likely to be acceptable, subject to detailed consideration against identified policy criteria. Reference should be made to Scottish Government planning and renewable energy policy. In the first instance, this is Scottish Planning Policy (June 2014) paragraphs 161 to 174, in the context of the overarching policy of ""A Low Carbon Place"".  It should be noted that some terminology relating to ""spatial frameworks"" and ""areas of search"" may no longer be in use, and reference should be made to planning advice on renewable energy (February 2017) at https://www.gov.scot/publications/renewables-planning-advice-index/"
