Data zones were initially set up to nest within council area boundaries and to have a population of between 500 and 1,000 household residents. As much as possible, data zones were set up to contain households with similar social characteristics and to take into consideration physical boundaries. More information on data zone geography can be found on the\u00a0Scottish Government\u00a0website. There are 6,976 data zones in Scotland.Following the 2011 Census the Scottish Government completed a consultation on the redrawing of data zone boundary and finalised the new data zones. 2011 Data Zones were published at the end of 2014.Intermediate zones are built up from data zones. Intermediate zones are the statistical small geographical areas designed to contain a population of between 2,500 and 6,000 household residents. There are 1,235 intermediate zones in Scotland.
