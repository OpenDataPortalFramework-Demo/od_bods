notes: "<h1>Percentage of time in the last 6 months of life spent at home or in a\
  \ community setting.</h1>\n<p>This data provides information in support of the Scottish\
  \ Government\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0049/00491388.pdf\">Strategic\
  \ Framework for Action on Palliative and End of Life Care</a> which has one of its\
  \ commitments to \u201Csupport improvements in the collection, analysis, interpretation\
  \ and dissemination of data and evidence relating to needs, provision, activity,\
  \ indicators and outcomes in respect of palliative and end of life care\u201D. </p>\n\
  <p>The percentage of time in the last 6 months of life spent at home or in a community\
  \ setting provides a high level indication of progress in implementation of the\
  \ strategic framework for action. This is inferred by measuring the amount of time\
  \ spent in a hospital setting during the last months of life (using hospital admissions\
  \ data) and from this estimating the time spent at home or in a community setting.</p>"
