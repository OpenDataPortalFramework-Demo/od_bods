In 1970, at the start of his career, one of his outfits was selected by Vogue magazine as **Dress of the Year**. Two years later he formed his own fashion house, **Bill Gibb Ltd**, and launched his first solo collection to critical acclaim. His designs were applauded for their startling combinations of colour, texture and pattern. Collaborating with knitwear designer Kaffe Fassett, he created a signature style of layered knits for women. Gibb also gained a reputation for romantic grandeur, dressing celebrities such as model Twiggy and popstars Lulu and Cilla Black. He continued to design for private clients until his death.   \r    \r In 1997 his archive of sketched designs and swatches was bought by Aberdeen City Council: Museums and Gallery with help from supporters including the **Friends of Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museums**. We continue to add to the collection of outfits and accessories designed by Bill Gibb, and currently hold more than 100 items of clothing, plus numerous other items associated with him.   \r    \r To discover the full extent of the collection and see images search for Bill Gibb on the [Art Gallery Catalogue](http:\/\/www.aagm.co.uk\/TheCollections\/BasicSearch.aspx?dosearch=y&Artists=Gibb+Bill&Title=&chat=) (please note, all images are \u00a9 Aberdeen Art Gallery & Museums Collections).  This dataset lists all the Bill Gibb items in the collection database.  We are releasing it as open data to increase public awareness of Bill Gibb, and increase access to this collection.  We are keen to hear of any novel uses this data is used for.

By the early 1850s he was established in **Aberdeen** as an **artist and portrait photographer**. He received a contract to photograph the Royal Family, working for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and was later commissioned to **illustrate Queen Victoria\u2019s diaries** of her time in Scotland when they were published. By the 1860s he was increasingly focussed on landscapes and stereoscopic views.   \r    \r This dataset is a list of all the items relating to **George Washington Wilson**, his company and successor companies, held by Aberdeen Art Gallery & Museums. We are releasing it as open data to increase public awareness of, and access to, the collection.
